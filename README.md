# 🎄 Advent of Code 2025 🎄

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code
2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025). My goal is to solve every puzzle using
nothing else but base R. No packages! (EDIT: except what turned out to be
an obvious integer linear programming problem in Day 10, Part 2.)

### Why on Earth would you use R for this?

Several reasons. First, R is my favourite programming language. There, I said it.

More accurately, my original plan was to use the 2025 edition to learn an array
programming language (maybe APL), especially given the more relaxed pace of
Advent of Code this year with fewer puzzles. Oh how naive I was. There was
absolutely zero chance that I would manage to learn a challenging new
programming language while battling with algorithms at the same time.
Anyway, being a vectorized functional programming language, R is not _that_ far
off, so I decided to stick with  it
[again](https://github.com/bodkan/adventofcode2021). Fair warning: at every point
I focused on maximizing fun and _"I wonder if I could do it like that?"_ attitude
over efficiency.
