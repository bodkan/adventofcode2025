# 🎄 Advent of Code 2025 🎄

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code
2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025). My goal is to solve every puzzle using
nothing else but base R. No packages!

### Solutions

- [Day 1 puzzle](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/1) - [my solution](day-01.R)
- [Day 2 puzzle](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/2) - [my solution](day-02.R)
- [Day 3 puzzle](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/3) - [my solution](day-03.R)

### Why on Earth would you use R for this?

Several reasons. First, R is my favourite programming language. There, I said it.

More accurately, my original plan was to use the 2025 edition to learn an array
programming language (maybe APL), especially given the more relaxed pace of
Advent of Code this year. Oh how naive I was. There was absolutely zero chance
that I would manage to learn a challenging new programming language while
battling with algorithms at the same time.

Anyway, R being a vectorized functional programming language is not _that_ far
off, so I decided to stick with  it
[again](https://github.com/bodkan/adventofcode2021). Fair warning, in the spirit
of vectorization and functional programming in R, I often push the "no-loops"
attitude to the extreme. My solutions are silly and weird. Whenever I asked
myself "I wonder if I could do it _like that_?", I just went for it.
